# MSFS 2020 WebUI DevKit

This devkit is a mod and guidance for easier development of WebUI (Panels, MFD..) in Microsoft Flightsimulator 2020.

The goal is to make the process of developing UIs in MSFS as painless as possible with more stuff to come.

## Features
* Hotreload HTML/CSS/JS changes without restarting the sim or flight
* View console.log output in the game
* Action buttons
* Basic HTML inspector (click on element)
* Panel FPS counter (configurable)
* _[TODO] Devtool like debugging UI_ / see [devtools-backend-refurb](https://github.com/dga711/devtools-backend-refurb)
* _[TODO] Load content from local webserver_
* ...

### Hotkeys
* ALT + T = Open/Close Panel
* ALT + R = Reload page

## Installation

* Download the latest zip release [here](https://github.com/dga711/msfs-webui-devkit/releases).
* Extract the "WebUi-Devkit" folder to the _community_ folder in your MSFS installation  
_or_  
* Clone the repo into your _community_ folder


## Usage

### Part 1: The code

To show the debugging UI in the panel/mfd of your choice you should put this code into the corresponding JS file (_init()_ or end of _connectedcallback()_ method works well)
```        
if (typeof g_modDebugMgr != "undefined") {
    g_modDebugMgr.AddConsole(null);
}
```
With the undefined-check in place you don't have to worry it will crash on people who don't have the DevKit in their installation.

**Note**: It does matter where you put the initialization. Mostly dependent on inheritance of the classes. So maybe you have to try to find the right spot for your init code.

**Tip**: To show the UI on all screens on all planes, put the code in the _connectedCallback()_ method of the _NavSystem_ class in the _NavSystems.js_

### Part 2: The ingame UI
In game, on any panel where you activated the code, it should show an opaque UI Element in the top right corner.

Press on the "R" button to refresh the HTML Content of the panel.  
Press "X" to show the console output.

**Important**: To be able to click on it on cockpit panels you have to bind the "New UI Window Mode" key in MsFs. Then press that key and click on a glass panel. It will pop out in a window.

### Part 3: Console Logging
In the JS corresponding to the activated panel, any `console.log()` output should show up in the console panel in game.

### Part 4: Action Buttons
```g_modDebugMgr.AddDebugButton("InsertTitleHere", function() {dosomething});```
This will show a button in the open debug UI which executes the function when clicked.


## Known Limitations

* Sometimes seems to fail refresh of sources no matter what you do.   
HTML/CSS usually always refreshes. When it fails for JS for you, a workaround would be to add a querystring to the import in the HTML file of the panel to bust the cache. Ofc I will work on ways to make this obsolete.
